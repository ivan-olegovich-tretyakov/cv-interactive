# Ivan Tretyakov: Executive Job Search Strategy — Complete Playbook

**Target:** €200k+ senior role in CPG/FMCG or adjacent industries within 6 months
**Location:** Frankfurt/Hesse, hybrid/remote acceptable
**Current status:** Employed at Buynomics (Director, Value Advisory & Commercial Strategy)

---

## Part 1: Strategic positioning and narrative

### Why your profile is rare

Your career arc creates a genuinely differentiated positioning that few candidates in DACH can match. You combine deep CPG operational experience (20+ years including 6 years leading RGM at Danone Germany) with hands-on exposure to AI-driven pricing technology at Buynomics. As CPG companies race to digitize their commercial functions, this bridge between traditional RGM wisdom and modern AI-powered strategy is increasingly sought after.

### The narrative to control

The move from Danone to Buynomics should be framed as a deliberate strategic choice: "I chose Buynomics to gain hands-on experience with the AI and data-driven pricing technology reshaping the CPG industry." The return to a larger organization becomes: "I'm bringing both the innovation mindset from the startup world and the enterprise discipline from 20+ years in CPG to drive transformation at scale."

### Target role titles

Head of Revenue Growth Management, VP Commercial Strategy, Director Pricing Strategy, Head of Commercial Excellence, VP Strategy & Innovation, Director Digital Transformation, Chief Digital Officer. You're open to anything at the right level and compensation.

---

## Part 2: The hidden job market and channel strategy

At the €200k+ level in Germany, the overwhelming majority of roles are filled through the hidden job market. German Federal Employment Agency data indicates only around 30% of vacancies reach online portals. A University of Zurich study found approximately 80% of available positions are never publicly advertised. At executive level, referrals account for only about 7% of applicants but generate roughly 72% of interviews.

### Recommended time allocation

- **40% — Networking and hidden job market cultivation** (this is your highest-ROI activity)
- **30% — Executive headhunter relationship management**
- **20% — Direct approaches to target companies**
- **10% — Job board monitoring**

---

## Part 3: Executive search firms

### Tier 1: The "SHREK" firms (global top 5)

Each maintains a dedicated Consumer/CPG practice with DACH offices:

**Egon Zehnder** — Headquartered in Zurich, dominant in Europe, Frankfurt office of 12 consultants. Unique partnership structure. Does not accept unsolicited resumes; connect with individual consumer practice consultants via LinkedIn.

**Spencer Stuart** — Frankfurt office, ~18 consultants. Has a dedicated candidate registration portal at candidateregistration.spencerstuart.com — register immediately. Strong Consumer industry practice.

**Heidrick & Struggles** — Frankfurt, Munich, Düsseldorf, and Hamburg. Consumer Goods & Retail practice is directly relevant. Acquired Atreus in 2023 for executive interim management — a potential bridge-role channel. Has a "Talk to Heidrick" contact form.

**Korn Ferry** — World's largest search firm, five German offices. Consumer practice consultants actively source on LinkedIn. Their acquisition of Hay Group gives them deep compensation benchmarking data relevant to RGM/pricing roles.

**Russell Reynolds** — Frankfurt, Munich, and Hamburg with a dedicated Consumer & Retail practice. Strong in CEO succession and leadership assessment.

### Tier 2: Boutique and CPG-specialist firms

**Nigel Wright Group** — Europe's leading consumer-industry-only search firm, 35+ years focus. Active in DACH with placements at Pernod Ricard, Schleich, Weleda, Christian Dior. Highest-priority boutique firm for your profile.

**Robert Breitbach Consulting** — Retained FMCG-only search firm since 1993, recruiting Commercial Directors, E-commerce Directors, Managing Directors across Europe.

**Odgers Berndtson** — Frankfurt, Munich, Berlin with Consumer Products practice. Also offers interim management through Odgers Interim.

**Departer** — DACH specialist with deep Mittelstand expertise. Offers an "Arriver concept" for executives returning to Germany from international roles.

**Simon-Kucher & Partners** — Global leader in pricing strategy (HQ in Bonn, near Frankfurt). Both a networking target and potential employer given your RGM expertise.

Additional firms: Boyden Germany, Michael Page Executive, Robert Walters Executive Search, Mercuri Urval, Signium, HSH+S Headhunters (based 30 min from Frankfurt).

### Three essential executive platforms

**Experteer** — Germany's premier executive job board, 8M+ senior professionals, 10,000+ headhunters, focused on €60k+ salaries. Premium unlocks confidential roles.

**BlueSteps** (by AESC) — Visibility to 16,000+ search consultants across 70 countries. Members report 25% faster career moves.

**GatedTalent** — Free privacy-focused profile visible to executive recruiters globally.

### How to approach headhunters in Germany

Executive search firms work for client companies, not candidates. The most effective approach:

- Target specific consultants, not firms. Research who covers Consumer/CPG in DACH.
- Lead with a concise pitch: "20+ years FMCG/CPG, most recently driving AI-powered pricing strategy at Buynomics after 6 years leading RGM at Danone Germany. Seeking VP/Director-level commercial strategy or RGM roles in DACH."
- Ask for an informational conversation, not help finding a job.
- German etiquette: formal address initially. Prepare a 2-page achievement-oriented CV in German format with professional photo, quantified P&L impact, team sizes. Have 3-4 senior references ready.

---

## Part 4: LinkedIn strategy

### Profile optimization

**Headline:** "Director, Value Advisory & Commercial Strategy @ Buynomics | RGM & Pricing Expert | 20+ Years CPG/FMCG | AI-Driven Revenue Growth | Ex-Danone"

**About section:** Executive positioning statement, not chronological bio. Open with leadership identity, follow with 3-5 quantified achievements (revenue growth %, margin improvements, team sizes), then keyword-optimized expertise areas: Revenue Growth Management, Pricing Strategy, Commercial Excellence, Digital Transformation, P&L Management, Net Revenue Management, Trade Promotion, Price Pack Architecture.

**Critical settings:** Enable "Open to Work" in recruiter-only mode (no public green banner). Configure target titles, locations (Frankfurt, DACH, Remote/Hybrid), and start date (Flexible). Turn off activity notifications so profile updates don't alert connections.

**Featured section:** Thought leadership posts, media appearances, links to relevant content. Request 5-8 recommendations from former Danone leaders, Buynomics clients, IE Business School connections.

### Thought leadership content strategy

Post 2-3 times per week across four content pillars: AI and data-driven pricing in CPG, RGM trends and maturity frameworks, commercial excellence challenges in DACH retail, and digital transformation of commercial functions.

Content mix: 40% original insight posts (200-300 words with frameworks or lessons), 25% commentary on industry news, 20% leadership stories, 15% engagement posts (polls, questions).

**Do not enable Creator Mode** during active job search — it replaces "Connect" with "Follow," reducing connection requests from recruiters by up to 40%.

**LinkedIn Premium:** Sales Navigator Core (~€100/month) recommended for aggressive search — 50 InMail credits monthly, advanced filters, lead tracking.

### Personal website

Optional but differentiating for CDO/digital transformation roles. Clean single-page site on Squarespace (~€150/year). Only pursue if bandwidth allows after LinkedIn optimization is complete.

## Part 5: OpenClaw — honest audit of every suggested skill

### What OpenClaw is (and isn't)

OpenClaw is an open-source AI agent runtime that runs on your machine or VPS and can execute autonomous workflows — browsing the web, managing files, posting content, sending alerts via WhatsApp/Telegram. It extends via "Skills" from ClawHub (5,700+ community skills). Setup cost is ~€40-60/month (VPS + LLM API).

**However, my initial playbook oversold several skills.** After auditing each one against actual documentation, install counts, LinkedIn's official policies, and recent security advisories from Microsoft, CrowdStrike, and Trend Micro, here's the honest picture.

### Critical security context

Before adopting any OpenClaw skills, you need to understand the risk landscape:

- **Microsoft Defender recommends using OpenClaw only in isolated environments** that don't have access to non-dedicated credentials or data. They classify it as "untrusted code execution with persistent credentials."
- **Trend Micro found malicious ClawHub skills distributing the Atomic macOS Stealer** — attackers uploaded professional-looking skills that installed infostealers capable of stealing API keys and gaining remote control of the agent.
- **CrowdStrike flagged OpenClaw** as a growing security concern due to prompt injection risks and misconfiguration vulnerabilities.
- **30,000+ exposed instances** were found on the public internet in just two weeks by Bitsight.

This doesn't mean OpenClaw is unusable — it means you must treat it like a powerful but dangerous tool. Install on an **isolated VPS only**, never on your personal machine. Vet every skill before installing. Keep it sandboxed and use approval modes for all actions.

### Skill-by-skill audit

#### ✅ Skill 1: `job-auto-apply` — USABLE WITH CAVEATS

**Registry status:** Published in official openclaw/skills repo. Health score B83/100. 1,300 stars, 110 weekly installs. First seen 25 days ago.

**What it actually does:** Searches LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, ZipRecruiter, and Wellfound. Calculates match scores. Generates tailored cover letters. Can auto-fill application forms. Tracks everything in JSON.

**How it works technically:** Browser automation (Puppeteer/Playwright), not official APIs. It opens a headless browser, navigates to job sites, scrapes listings, and fills forms programmatically.

**LinkedIn compliance:** The LinkedIn features violate LinkedIn's Terms of Service Section 8.2, which explicitly prohibits "bots or other automated methods to access the Services, add or download contacts, send or redirect messages." LinkedIn detection has improved significantly in 2025-2026 with behavioral AI that flags non-human patterns. Browser-based extensions carry a 60% higher detection risk than cloud-based tools.

**Recommendation:** Use for Indeed, Glassdoor, and ZipRecruiter only. Exclude LinkedIn from the automation. Set `default_platforms: ["indeed", "glassdoor"]` and handle LinkedIn manually. Keep `require_confirmation: true` and `max_daily_applications: 3-5` — at your seniority level, targeted quality beats volume.

**Risk level for LinkedIn features:** HIGH. Account restriction or permanent ban is possible. A LinkedIn ban during an active executive job search would be catastrophic.

#### ⚠️ Skill 2: `linkedin-job-application` — HIGH RISK, NOT RECOMMENDED

**What it claims:** Automated LinkedIn Easy Apply, form auto-fill, resume upload, screening question answering, recruiter outreach automation.

**How it works:** Pure browser automation — opens LinkedIn in a headless browser, clicks through Easy Apply modals, fills forms via CSS selectors.

**Why it's problematic beyond LinkedIn ToS:**
- LinkedIn frequently changes its UI, breaking selectors. The skill requires constant maintenance.
- Easy Apply modal flows vary by employer, causing unpredictable failures.
- Automated connection requests have a hard cap (~100/week) and high "I don't know this person" click-through triggers immediate account restrictions.
- LinkedIn's 2026 behavioral AI detects "heartbeat patterns" — perfectly timed actions that no human would produce.

**Recommendation:** Do not use this skill for LinkedIn. The risk-to-reward ratio is terrible for an executive job search. If your LinkedIn account gets restricted, you lose access to your single most important visibility platform. Instead, do all LinkedIn activity manually — it's a higher-touch, lower-volume search anyway.

#### ⚠️ Skill 3: `linkedin-automator` — MIXED, USE ONLY FOR CONTENT DRAFTING

**What it claims:** Content creation, posting, engagement tracking, audience growth, analytics.

**How it works:** Browser automation with a logged-in LinkedIn session. Scripts that control the browser to create posts, like content, comment on posts, and pull analytics.

**LinkedIn's official position:** "If we detect excessive comment creation or use of an automation tool, we may limit the visibility of those comments." Automated posting, liking, and commenting all violate ToS Section 8.2.

**The LinkedIn API reality:** The official Community Management API allows posting for organizations (company pages), but **r_member_social (personal profile posting) is a CLOSED permission** — LinkedIn is not accepting access requests at this time. The free "Share on LinkedIn" API product only allows basic sharing. In short, there is no legitimate API path for automating personal profile posts.

**What you CAN safely use OpenClaw for:**
- **Content DRAFTING** — Have the agent generate all your LinkedIn post drafts, organized in a content calendar. Then copy-paste and post manually. This is 100% safe and saves most of the creative time.
- **Analytics tracking** — Use LinkedIn's native analytics or Sales Navigator instead.
- **Engagement** — Do this manually. It takes 10-15 minutes/day and the personal touch matters more for networking.

**Recommendation:** Install for content generation only. Do NOT enable automated posting, commenting, or engagement features. The safe workflow: Agent generates drafts → sends them to you via WhatsApp → you review → you manually post on LinkedIn.

#### ✅ Skill 4: `job-search-mcp` (JobSpy) — SAFE AND USEFUL

**What it does:** Aggregates job listings from LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, ZipRecruiter, Google Jobs into a unified feed via the JobSpy MCP Server. Returns structured data (title, company, salary, location, description).

**How it works:** Web scraping of publicly available job listings. Does NOT log into your accounts or interact with platforms on your behalf.

**Risk level:** LOW. Reading public job listings is fundamentally different from automating actions on your account. This is essentially an enhanced RSS feed.

**Recommendation:** This is the most useful and lowest-risk skill. Install it. Configure for DACH executive roles. Have it run morning searches and send you a digest via WhatsApp. This is where OpenClaw adds the most value with the least risk — replacing your need to manually check 6 job boards every day.

**Configuration:**
```
Titles: "Head of", "VP", "Director", "Chief" + "Revenue Growth", "Pricing", 
        "Commercial", "Strategy", "Digital Transformation"
Location: Germany (expand to DACH if needed)
Seniority: Director, VP, C-suite
Schedule: Daily at 7:00 AM → WhatsApp digest
```

#### ⚠️ Skill 5: Ironclaw CRM — USEFUL BUT SECURITY-SENSITIVE

**What it is:** AI-powered local CRM built on OpenClaw. DuckDB database, natural language queries, pipeline management, lead enrichment.

**How it works:** Runs at localhost:3100. Stores contacts, tracks pipeline. For LinkedIn enrichment, it **copies your existing Chrome profile** — all auth sessions, cookies, history — and uses it to browse LinkedIn as you.

**Security concern:** This means giving OpenClaw full access to your LinkedIn session (and every other service you're logged into in Chrome). Microsoft explicitly warns against signing agents into personal browser profiles. If the agent is compromised via prompt injection or a malicious skill, an attacker would have your full LinkedIn (and other) session access.

**Recommendation:** Use Ironclaw for CRM and pipeline tracking (the DuckDB + natural language query part is excellent). Do NOT enable Chrome profile browsing for LinkedIn enrichment. Instead, enrich contacts manually or use LinkedIn Sales Navigator's built-in lead management. If you do use the browser features, create a dedicated Chrome profile that is only logged into LinkedIn and nothing else.

**Safe alternative for CRM:** A custom Notion database or Airtable with these fields: Company, Role, Source (headhunter/direct/referral), Stage (Identified → Applied → Interview → Offer), Salary range, Bonus structure, Next follow-up, Recruiter contact, Priority rating. Less fancy than Ironclaw, but zero security risk.

### OpenClaw skills — final recommendation matrix

| Skill | Use? | Risk | What to use it for | What NOT to use it for |
|-------|------|------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| `job-search-mcp` | ✅ YES | Low | Daily job board scanning across all platforms | N/A |
| `todoist` | ✅ YES | Low | Action queue for all prepared items (applications, messages, posts, follow-ups) | N/A — uses official Todoist API |
| `topic-monitor` | ✅ YES | Low | Industry trends, exec moves, company news, event tracking | N/A — web search only, no account interaction |
| `blogwatcher` | ✅ YES | Low | RSS monitoring of industry publications and consulting firm blogs | N/A |
| `job-auto-apply` | ✅ Partial | Medium | Indeed/Glassdoor/ZipRecruiter applications only | LinkedIn applications |
| `linkedin-automator` | ✅ Partial | Low if draft-only | Generating content drafts and calendars | Automated posting, commenting, engagement |
| Ironclaw | ✅ Partial | Medium-High | CRM pipeline tracking and reporting | Chrome profile browsing / LinkedIn enrichment |
| `linkedin-job-application` | ❌ NO | High | Nothing | Everything — too risky for executive search |
| Dedicated Chrome profile | ✅ YES | Low | Reading walled job posts via PA LinkedIn account | Sending messages, applying, or engaging |

### Additional skill: Todoist as your action queue

The missing piece from the original playbook was a clear handoff mechanism — how does OpenClaw's automated research, draft preparation, and contact discovery actually reach you as actionable items you can knock out during your daily 30-45 minute window?

**Skill:** `todoist` (official OpenClaw skill, multiple versions available)
```bash
npx playbooks add skill openclaw/skills --skill todoist
```

**How it works:** Uses the official Todoist REST API via a CLI tool. You provide your API token (free from todoist.com/app/settings/integrations/developer). OpenClaw can then create tasks, set due dates and priorities, assign projects, add labels, and manage completion — all programmatically. This works with Todoist Free, though Premium adds filters and reminders.

**The architecture: OpenClaw researches → Todoist queues → You execute**

Set up these Todoist projects to organize everything OpenClaw produces:

| Todoist project | What OpenClaw puts here | Your action |
|----------------|------------------------|-------------|
| 📋 Applications | "Apply to Head of Pricing at P&G Schwalbach — CV draft ready, cover letter draft ready [link to files]" with due date | Review drafts, refine, submit manually |
| 🤝 Recruiter Outreach | "Send intro to [Name] at Korn Ferry Frankfurt — message draft: [text]" Priority 1 | Copy message, send via LinkedIn manually |
| 💬 LinkedIn Posts | "Post ready for review: 'Why global RGM playbooks fail in German retail' [full draft text in comment]" scheduled for tomorrow | Copy-paste to LinkedIn, post manually |
| 🔄 Follow-ups | "Follow up with Nigel Wright recruiter (sent intro 14 days ago, no reply) — draft follow-up: [text]" Priority 2 | Review draft, send via LinkedIn/email |
| 🎯 Networking | "Reach out to [IE Alumni name] at Ferrero — they posted about RGM hiring. Suggested message: [text]" | Send personalized message |
| 📰 Content Ideas | "Trending: McKinsey published new RGM maturity report — draft commentary post ready [text in comment]" | Review, refine, post to LinkedIn |
| 📅 Events | "Register for EPP RGM Forum — early bird deadline March 15 — link: [URL]" Priority 1 | Click link, register |

**Daily workflow example:**

Every morning at 7:00, OpenClaw runs its scans and pushes results directly to Todoist:
- 3 new job matches → creates Application tasks with CV/letter draft links
- 2 follow-ups overdue → creates Follow-up tasks with draft messages
- 1 LinkedIn post scheduled for today → creates LinkedIn Posts task with full draft in comments
- 1 industry news item worth commenting on → creates Content Ideas task

You open Todoist (mobile or desktop), see your prioritized queue, and execute each item in 30-45 minutes. No context-switching between tools. No wondering "what should I do today?"

**Configuration in OpenClaw:**
Tell the agent: "For every actionable item you prepare — job applications, recruiter messages, LinkedIn posts, follow-ups, networking outreach — create a Todoist task in the appropriate project with the draft content in the task comments, a due date, and priority level. Never execute these actions yourself. Your job is to prepare; I execute."

**Why Todoist over Notion:** Todoist has a robust official API, a native OpenClaw skill that's well-tested, excellent mobile app for on-the-go execution, and built-in priority/due-date sorting. Notion is more powerful for databases but slower to act on from your phone while commuting.

### Safe browser approach: dedicated profile for walled content

You're right that many job postings and executive profiles are behind login walls, especially on LinkedIn, Experteer, and company career portals. The solution is a **dedicated browser profile** that doesn't expose your primary credentials.

**Setup a "PA" (Personal Assistant) LinkedIn profile:**

Create a separate LinkedIn account specifically for research purposes. This is a legitimate secondary profile used as a reading/research account — not for outreach or impersonation.

- Use a different email address (e.g., a dedicated Gmail)
- Real but minimal profile (your name + "Research" or simply leave it basic)
- Connect to no one — this is purely for reading walled content
- No posting, no messaging, no connecting from this account
- Log into this account ONLY in the dedicated Chrome profile on your VPS

**Configure the dedicated Chrome profile on your VPS:**
```
# Create isolated Chrome profile directory
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/chrome-profiles/job-search

# In OpenClaw config, point browser to this profile only
# Never use your personal Chrome profile
```

**What the agent can safely do with this setup:**
- Read full job descriptions behind LinkedIn login walls
- View company career pages that require registration
- Access Experteer listings that need authentication
- Read XING job posts behind login
- Browse recruiter profiles to prepare outreach briefs for you

**What it should NOT do:**
- Send messages, connection requests, or applications from this profile
- Post content or engage with posts
- Access any service where your primary credentials matter

**Security boundaries:**
- This Chrome profile is logged into ONLY the PA LinkedIn account and job board accounts
- Your primary LinkedIn credentials never touch the VPS
- If the VPS is compromised, attackers get access to a throwaway LinkedIn research account, not your real one
- Enable `exec_approval` so you can see what URLs the agent visits

### Fully automated content pipeline (draft-only)

Your idea is sound: OpenClaw handles the entire content creation process, including monitoring industry trends and generating commentary drafts. You just do the 2-minute manual posting.

**How this works end-to-end:**

**Layer 1: Industry monitoring (runs automatically via cron)**

Install the `topic-monitor` skill and `blogwatcher` skill:
```bash
# Topic monitoring with AI-powered importance scoring
npx playbooks add skill openclaw/skills --skill topic-monitor

# RSS/Atom feed monitoring
npx playbooks add skill openclaw/skills --skill blogwatcher
```

Configure monitoring topics:
```
Topics to monitor:
- "Revenue Growth Management CPG" — keywords: RGM, pricing strategy, 
  trade promotion, price pack architecture, net revenue management
- "FMCG digital transformation" — keywords: AI pricing, CPG analytics, 
  commercial excellence, digital commercial
- "German retail market" — keywords: Edeka, Rewe, Aldi, Lidl, 
  German grocery, DACH retail
- "Executive moves CPG" — keywords: new CEO, new VP, appointed, 
  joined, [target company names]

RSS feeds to monitor:
- McKinsey Consumer & Retail insights
- Bain CPG practice blog
- NielsenIQ insights
- Kantar knowledge hub
- Lebensmittel Zeitung (German retail trade press)
- The Grocer
- CPGmatters
- Buynomics blog (your current employer's content — know what they publish)

Frequency: Check every 6 hours
Alert threshold: Only surface items scoring "high" relevance
```

**Layer 2: Content generation (triggered by monitoring)**

When the monitor finds something relevant, OpenClaw generates a ready-to-post draft:

Cron job (daily, 8 PM — preparing tomorrow's content):
```
"Review today's industry monitoring results. For the highest-relevance item, 
generate a LinkedIn post draft (200-300 words) that:
1. Summarizes the news/trend in 1-2 sentences
2. Adds my perspective from 20+ years in CPG and current AI pricing work
3. Includes a discussion question at the end
4. Uses a professional but approachable tone
5. Does NOT use hashtags excessively (max 3)

Create a Todoist task in the 'LinkedIn Posts' project with:
- Task title: Post topic + target date
- Full draft text in the task comments
- Link to the source article
- Due date: tomorrow
- Priority: 2

Also generate 2-3 suggested comments I could leave on other people's 
industry posts today. Put these in a separate Todoist task labeled 
'Engagement comments' with the target post URLs and draft comment text."
```

**Layer 3: Scheduled content calendar**

Beyond reactive commentary, the agent maintains a proactive content calendar:

Tell the agent once:
```
"Create a 12-week LinkedIn content calendar. I want to post 3x per week.

Content pillars:
1. AI-driven pricing in CPG (my Buynomics angle)
2. RGM trends and maturity frameworks (my Danone experience)  
3. Digital transformation of commercial functions
4. Leadership lessons from 20+ years in FMCG

Week rhythm:
- Monday: Original insight post (framework, lesson, case study)
- Wednesday: Commentary on current industry news (from monitoring)
- Friday: Engagement post (poll, question, or leadership story)

Generate all 36 posts as drafts. Store them in a markdown file on 
the VPS. Each week, push the next 3 posts to Todoist with appropriate 
due dates and full text in comments."
```

**Your total effort per post: ~2 minutes** (open Todoist → read draft → copy → paste into LinkedIn → minor edits → post). The agent did 95% of the work.

### Automated intelligence gathering: events, people moves, exec search news

This is where OpenClaw's cron + web search + topic monitoring combination really shines — pure information gathering that requires no interaction with any platform.

**Monitor 1: Executive movements at target companies**

Cron schedule: Daily at 7 AM
```
"Search for recent executive appointments, departures, and organizational 
changes at these companies: Nestlé Germany, P&G Germany, Henkel, Ferrero, 
L'Oréal Germany, Mondelēz, Beiersdorf, SAP, Coca-Cola Europacific, 
Werner & Mertz, Dr. Oetker, JAB Holding.

Focus on: VP/Director/C-suite level moves in commercial, strategy, pricing, 
RGM, digital transformation roles.

If you find anything:
- Create a Todoist task in 'Networking' with the person's name, new role, 
  and a suggested connection message
- Flag if the move creates a vacancy I should apply to
- Note if the person is someone I should congratulate (warm outreach opportunity)"
```

**Monitor 2: Executive search firm activity**

Cron schedule: Weekly (Monday 7 AM)
```
"Search for recent news, new mandates, and team changes at: 
Spencer Stuart, Egon Zehnder, Heidrick & Struggles, Korn Ferry, 
Russell Reynolds, Nigel Wright, Odgers Berndtson, Robert Breitbach.

Focus on: new consumer/CPG practice hires in DACH, published thought 
leadership on commercial roles, any press releases about new mandates 
in CPG/FMCG.

If you find relevant activity:
- Create a Todoist task suggesting I reach out to the relevant consultant
- Include the news item as context for a personalized message"
```

**Monitor 3: Industry events and conferences**

Cron schedule: Bi-weekly
```
"Search for upcoming CPG, FMCG, RGM, pricing, and commercial excellence 
conferences and events in Europe for the next 6 months. Include:
- Registration deadlines and early bird pricing
- Speaker opportunities (I should apply to speak at relevant events)
- Networking dinners or executive roundtables
- Webinars from consulting firms (McKinsey, Bain, BCG, Simon-Kucher)

For each relevant event, create a Todoist task in 'Events' with:
- Event name, date, location, cost
- Why it's relevant for my job search
- Registration deadline as due date
- Whether I should attend, speak, or just network"
```

**Monitor 4: Target company news**

Cron schedule: Daily
```
"Check for recent news about my target companies: restructurings, 
new product launches, quarterly results, strategy announcements, 
leadership changes, M&A activity.

This intelligence serves two purposes:
1. Interview preparation — if I'm in process with a company, surface 
   anything I should know
2. Content fodder — flag anything I could comment on in a LinkedIn post

Push relevant items to Todoist in appropriate projects."
```

## Part 9: Salary negotiation in the German €200k+ market

### Compensation structure at Director/VP level

| Component | Typical range | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Base salary | €140,000–€170,000 | Fixed, paid monthly |
| Annual bonus (STI) | €40,000–€60,000 | At 100% target, tied to company + individual KPIs |
| Long-term incentive | Variable | More common at multinationals (P&G, Unilever, Nestlé offer RSUs/PSUs) |
| Company car (Dienstwagen) | €12,000–€18,000/yr value | Standard at this level. EV gets favorable 0.25% tax treatment vs 1% for combustion |
| Pension (bAV) | Employer-funded | Negotiate beyond mandatory minimum; tax-advantaged up to ~€7,248/year |

At €200k+ gross, effective tax + social contributions are approximately 40%, yielding roughly €9,500–€10,500 monthly net.

### German negotiation culture

Germans value directness and data-driven arguments. First offers are generally reasonable. Excessive demands are viewed negatively. Negotiate the full package holistically: base, bonus, car (specify electric for tax efficiency), pension, vacation days (target 30+), professional development budget, signing bonus. Get everything in the Arbeitsvertrag.

**Benchmarking resources:** Kienbaum Vergütungsreport, Robert Walters Salary Survey, StepStone Gehaltsreport, Gehalt.de.

## Part 10: The six-month action plan

### Month 1: Foundation and activation (Weeks 1-4)

**Weeks 1-2: Strategic positioning**
- Complete self-assessment: target roles, must-haves, deal-breakers
- Build target company list of 30-50 organizations
- Rewrite executive CV (2 pages, German format, professional photo, quantified achievements)
- Overhaul LinkedIn profile (headline, About, keywords, Featured section)
- Enable "Open to Work" (recruiter-only mode)
- Upgrade to LinkedIn Sales Navigator
- Register on Spencer Stuart portal, Experteer Premium, BlueSteps, GatedTalent, XING Premium
- **Review Buynomics employment contract**: notice period, non-compete clause, equity vesting
- Set up OpenClaw on isolated VPS, install job-search-mcp for daily scanning
- Set up CRM (Ironclaw for pipeline tracking, or Notion alternative)

**Weeks 3-4: Outreach activation**
- Contact consumer practice consultants at each SHREK firm via LinkedIn (personalized messages)
- Send introductory emails to Nigel Wright, Breitbach, Odgers Berndtson, Departer
- Begin LinkedIn thought leadership (1-2 posts/week, using OpenClaw-generated drafts posted manually)
- Request 5-8 LinkedIn recommendations
- Set job alerts on LinkedIn, Experteer, StepStone, XING, FAZ Stellenmarkt
- Configure OpenClaw morning briefing (job-search-mcp digest via WhatsApp)

**Weekly targets:** 5 recruiter outreach contacts, 3-5 networking conversations

### Months 2-3: Full-intensity search (Weeks 5-12)

- Apply to 3-5 targeted roles per week (use job-auto-apply for Indeed/Glassdoor; LinkedIn applications manually)
- 5-8 informational interviews weekly, framed as "Erfahrungsaustausch"
- Follow up with all recruiter contacts bi-weekly
- Attend 2-3 networking events monthly
- Increase LinkedIn posting to 3x/week, comment on 5-10 industry posts daily (manually)
- Register for EPP RGM Forum (May 27-29)
- Direct approaches to Nestlé Frankfurt, P&G Schwalbach, SAP Walldorf, Simon-Kucher Bonn

**Key milestone by end of Month 3:** 3-5 active recruiter conversations, 1-2 formal interview processes, 50+ new relevant contacts

### Months 4-5: Interview and negotiation (Weeks 13-20)

- Deep preparation for active processes (company research, Kununu reviews, interviewer profiles)
- Prepare customized 30-60-90 day plans for each target role
- Expect 3-4 interview rounds per company (HR → hiring manager → panel → C-level)
- Prepare total compensation requirements before negotiations
- Continue networking at reduced intensity (3 contacts/week)

### Month 6: Closing and contingency (Weeks 21-24)

- Evaluate offers against criteria matrix
- Final negotiation rounds
- If pipeline thin: expand to Switzerland, Austria, interim management roles, or adjacent industries not yet explored

**Timing note:** German hiring processes average 3 months from first interview to offer. Your notice period (likely 3 months) means aim for a signed offer by Month 6, with start date at Month 7-9. Avoid the June-August "Sommerloch" — front-load outreach in Months 1-3.

---

## Part 11: OpenClaw setup and daily operations

### Infrastructure setup (Day 1-2, ~3 hours)

1. Provision Hostinger VPS KVM 2 (~€9/month) or DigitalOcean droplet (~$12/month)
2. Install OpenClaw:

```

### Daily automated workflow

**7:00 AM — Morning scan (fully automated):**
- Job board scan results → matched roles become Todoist tasks in "Applications" project
- Follow-up reminders → overdue contacts become Todoist tasks in "Follow-ups"
- Industry monitoring results → relevant news becomes Todoist tasks in "Content Ideas"
- Executive movement alerts → connection opportunities become Todoist tasks in "Networking"

**8:00 PM — Evening content prep (fully automated):**
- Tomorrow's LinkedIn post draft → Todoist task in "LinkedIn Posts" with full text in comments
- Suggested engagement comments for tomorrow → Todoist task with target post URLs and drafts
- Weekly: exec search firm news digest → Todoist tasks in "Recruiter Outreach"
- Bi-weekly: upcoming events → Todoist tasks in "Events" with registration deadlines

**Your daily actions (30-45 min, all from Todoist):**
- Open Todoist → work through prioritized queue
- LinkedIn Posts: copy draft → paste into LinkedIn → tweak → post (2 min)
- Applications: review CV/cover letter drafts → refine → submit on Indeed/Glassdoor/company sites (10 min)
- Follow-ups: review draft messages → send via LinkedIn/email manually (5 min)
- Networking: send personalized outreach messages (5 min)
- Content engagement: post prepared comments on industry posts (5 min)

### Weekly routine

| Day | OpenClaw handles (automated) | You handle (from Todoist queue) |
|-----|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Mon | Job scan. Content draft for today. Follow-up reminders. Exec search firm weekly digest. | Post to LinkedIn. Send follow-ups. Review recruiter intel. |
| Tue | Research target companies. Generate CV/cover letter drafts for approved roles. People movement alerts. | Review applications. Send recruiter outreach. |
| Wed | Job scan. Content draft for today. Engagement comment drafts. | Post to LinkedIn. Comment on industry posts. |
| Thu | Pipeline status report. Interview prep briefings if needed. Event monitoring. | Review pipeline. Networking calls. Register for events. |
| Fri | Content draft for today. Next week's content calendar push. Weekly analytics summary. | Post to LinkedIn. Review content calendar. Plan networking. |

### Monthly costs

| Item | Cost/month |
|------|-----------|
| VPS hosting | €9-12 |
| Anthropic API | €30-50 |
| LinkedIn Sales Navigator | ~€100 |
| Experteer Premium | ~€30 |
| XING Premium | ~€30 |
| Todoist Pro (optional, free tier works) | €0-5 |
| **Total** | **~€200-225** |

**6-month total: ~€1,200-1,300** — significantly less than executive career coaches (€3,000-10,000).

---

## Part 12: What to avoid

### LinkedIn automation traps

- **Never automate connection requests, messaging, or Easy Apply.** LinkedIn's behavioral AI in 2026 detects non-human patterns (perfectly timed actions, linear activity graphs). Browser-based automation carries 60% higher detection risk. Account restrictions are tiered: 24-hour lockout → 3-14 day lock + ID verification → permanent ban with <15% recovery rate.
- **LinkedIn explicitly prohibits:** "bots or other unauthorized automated methods to access the Services, add or download contacts, send or redirect messages, create, comment on, like, share, or re-share posts, or otherwise drive inauthentic engagement."
- **The LinkedIn API is not a loophole.** Personal profile posting (r_member_social) is a CLOSED permission — LinkedIn is not accepting access requests. The Community Management API requires a registered legal entity. The free Share API is extremely limited.

### Mass-apply tools

Tools like Sonara, LoopCV, LazyApply, or the mass-apply features of any skill will damage your brand at executive level. Every application should be targeted and personalized.

### OpenClaw security

- Never install on your personal machine. VPS only.
- Vet every skill before installing (check VirusTotal report on ClawHub, read source code).
- The ClawHavoc supply chain attack proved that professional-looking skills can carry malware.
- Never let Ironclaw or any browser skill use your personal Chrome profile. Create a dedicated, minimal profile if browser features are needed.
- Keep OpenClaw behind a firewall, never exposed to the public internet.

---

## Part 13: OpenClaw implementation blueprint — feed this to your agent

> **Purpose:** This entire section is written as a step-by-step instruction set you can feed directly into OpenClaw (via SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, or simply pasted into a WhatsApp/Telegram conversation). It tells the agent exactly what to build, configure, and schedule. Work through it sequentially — each phase depends on the previous one.

---

### Phase 0: Model routing and configuration

**Your current stack:**
- Primary (easy tasks, heartbeats, daily ops): Gemini Flash 3.0 Preview
- Fallback: Gemini 2.5 Flash
- Complex reasoning (research, strategy, long content): Gemini 3.1 Pro
- All coding: Claude Code (delegated from OpenClaw)

**Recommended model assignment per job search task:**

| Task | Model | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| Heartbeats, cron triggers, system events | Gemini 2.5 Flash | Cheapest viable; no reasoning needed |
| Job board scanning (job-search-mcp) | Gemini Flash 3.0 Preview | Structured data parsing, filtering, matching — fast and cheap |
| Todoist task creation and management | Gemini Flash 3.0 Preview | Simple API calls, template-based text |
| RSS/blog monitoring (blogwatcher scans) | Gemini Flash 3.0 Preview | Feed parsing, basic relevance filtering |
| Daily briefing assembly | Gemini Flash 3.0 Preview | Aggregation of already-processed data |
| LinkedIn post drafting | Gemini 3.1 Pro | Needs strong writing quality, professional tone, strategic framing |
| Engagement comment drafting | Gemini 3.1 Pro | Must sound authentically human and insightful |
| CV/cover letter tailoring per role | Gemini 3.1 Pro | High-stakes written output, must match German executive expectations |
| Executive movement analysis | Gemini 3.1 Pro | Needs reasoning to assess relevance and draft personalized outreach |
| Interview prep briefings | Gemini 3.1 Pro | Deep company research, strategic question generation |
| Topic importance scoring (topic-monitor) | Gemini 3.1 Pro | Judgment call on what's worth alerting about |
| Content calendar generation (12-week plan) | Gemini 3.1 Pro | Strategic planning, pillar balancing, audience thinking |
| Recruiter message drafting | Gemini 3.1 Pro | Must be polished, personalized, executive-tone |
| Skill installation, config changes, scripting | Claude Code (via OpenClaw) | All coding and system configuration tasks |
| Browser automation scripts (if any) | Claude Code (via OpenClaw) | Reliability-critical code |
| Custom skill creation | Claude Code (via OpenClaw) | Full development lifecycle |

**Configuration to apply in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:**

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "model": {
        "primary": "google/gemini-3.0-flash-preview",
        "fallbacks": ["google/gemini-2.5-flash"]
      },
      "models": {
        "google/gemini-3.0-flash-preview": { "alias": "Flash" },
        "google/gemini-2.5-flash": { "alias": "Flash25" },
        "google/gemini-3.1-pro": { "alias": "Pro" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Model switching convention in cron prompts:**

For cron jobs that need Pro-level quality, prefix the prompt with `/model Pro` (or use the model override field if your OpenClaw version supports per-job model assignment). For simple scan-and-push jobs, let the default Flash handle it.

The principle: **Flash does the plumbing, Pro does the thinking, Claude Code does the building.**

---

### Phase 1: Foundation setup

**Instruction to agent:**

```
I'm setting up a 6-month executive job search system. You are my research assistant,
content creator, and task manager. You will NEVER execute any action on my behalf on
LinkedIn or any social platform. You will NEVER send messages, applications, or
connection requests. Your role is to research, draft, prepare, and queue — I execute.

Everything actionable you produce must end up as a Todoist task in the appropriate
project. I will work through Todoist as my daily execution queue.

Here is what I need you to build, in order. Confirm after each step before moving
to the next.
```

---

### Phase 1A: Install core skills

**Instruction to agent:**

```
Install the following skills. For each one, confirm installation was successful and
report any errors. Use Claude Code for all installation commands.

1. Todoist CLI and skill:
   npm install -g todoist-ts-cli@^0.2.0
   npx playbooks add skill openclaw/skills --skill todoist

2. Job board aggregator:
   pip install mcp>=1.1.0 python-jobspy>=1.1.82 pandas>=2.1.0
   git clone https://github.com/chinpeerapat/jobspy-mcp-server.git ~/jobspy-mcp-server

3. Topic monitor:
   npx playbooks add skill openclaw/skills --skill topic-monitor

4. Blog/RSS watcher:
   npx playbooks add skill openclaw/skills --skill blogwatcher

5. LinkedIn content drafting (draft-only mode):
   npx playbooks add skill openclaw/skills --skill linkedin-automation

6. Job auto-apply (for non-LinkedIn platforms):
   npx playbooks add skill openclaw/skills --skill job-auto-apply

After installing all skills, run `openclaw doctor --fix` and report the results.
```

---

### Phase 1B: Configure Todoist

**Instruction to agent:**

```
Set up Todoist integration:

1. Authenticate with Todoist using my API token: [YOUR_TOKEN_HERE]
   Run: todoist auth [TOKEN]

2. Create these projects in Todoist (use the CLI):
   - "📋 Job Applications" — for roles to apply to, with CV/cover letter drafts
   - "🤝 Recruiter Outreach" — for headhunter and recruiter contact tasks
   - "💬 LinkedIn Posts" — for content ready to copy-paste and post
   - "🔄 Follow-ups" — for overdue contacts and re-engagement drafts
   - "🎯 Networking" — for alumni, industry contacts, warm outreach
   - "📰 Content Ideas" — for industry news worth commenting on
   - "📅 Events & Deadlines" — for conferences, registration deadlines, webinars

3. Create these labels:
   - "draft-ready" — item has a complete draft attached
   - "needs-review" — item needs my input before it can be executed
   - "time-sensitive" — deadline approaching within 48 hours
   - "high-value" — senior role, key recruiter, or strategic contact

4. Verify by listing all projects and labels: todoist projects && todoist labels

Report the project IDs so I can reference them later.
```

---

### Phase 1C: Set up dedicated browser profile

**Instruction to agent (delegate to Claude Code):**

```
Create an isolated Chrome browser profile for reading walled job content.
This profile will NEVER be used for sending messages, applying, or engaging.

1. Create the profile directory:
   mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/chrome-profiles/job-search-pa

2. Create a setup script at ~/setup-pa-browser.sh that:
   - Launches Chrome with --user-data-dir=~/.openclaw/chrome-profiles/job-search-pa
   - Uses a unique window size (1280x900) to distinguish it visually
   - Opens LinkedIn login page so I can manually log in with the PA account

3. Document in a README.md at ~/.openclaw/chrome-profiles/README.md:
   - This profile is for the PA (Personal Assistant) LinkedIn account ONLY
   - Never sign into primary LinkedIn, email, banking, or any personal services
   - If the VPS is compromised, only the throwaway PA account is exposed
   - The agent may use this profile to READ job descriptions and company pages
   - The agent must NEVER use this profile to send messages, apply, or engage

4. In the OpenClaw browser tool config, point to this profile directory.
   Set exec_approval: true so I can see every URL the agent visits.
```

---

### Phase 1D: Create the SOUL.md persona

**Instruction to agent (delegate to Claude Code):**

```
Create ~/.openclaw/agents/main/SOUL.md with this content:

---
# Job Search Executive Assistant

## Identity
You are an executive job search assistant for Ivan Tretyakov, a senior CPG/FMCG
professional with 20+ years of experience seeking €200k+ roles in the DACH region.

## Core Rules — NEVER VIOLATE
1. You NEVER execute actions on LinkedIn or any social platform. No posting,
   commenting, connecting, messaging, or applying. You draft; Ivan executes.
2. Every actionable output you produce MUST become a Todoist task in the
   appropriate project. If it's not in Todoist, it doesn't exist.
3. You NEVER use Ivan's primary LinkedIn credentials or personal browser profile.
   Only the dedicated PA Chrome profile for reading walled content.
4. You NEVER auto-apply to LinkedIn jobs. The linkedin-job-application skill
   is permanently disabled.
5. All content you draft must sound like a senior CPG executive with AI/pricing
   expertise — not like an AI assistant. No corporate buzzwords, no generic
   language, no emoji in professional content.

## Ivan's Profile (use this context in all drafts)
- 20+ years in CPG/FMCG, including 6 years as Head of Revenue Growth Management
  at Danone Germany
- Currently Director of Innovations at Buynomics (AI-powered pricing analytics)
- MBA from IE Business School, Madrid
- Unique positioning: bridges traditional RGM and AI-driven pricing
- Narrative for career move: "I went to Buynomics to learn AI-powered pricing
  from the inside. Now I bring both the enterprise discipline and the technology
  vision back to a company that wants to lead in commercial excellence."
- Based in Frankfurt, Germany. Open to Frankfurt/Hesse or hybrid roles.
- Target roles: Head of RGM, VP Commercial Strategy, Director Pricing & Analytics,
  Chief Digital/Commercial Officer
- Target companies: Nestlé Germany, P&G Germany, Henkel, Ferrero, L'Oréal Germany,
  Mondelēz, Beiersdorf, SAP, Coca-Cola Europacific, Simon-Kucher, plus PE-backed
  CPG portfolio companies
- Target salary: €200K+ total compensation

## Tone Guidelines for Content
- LinkedIn posts: Insightful, data-informed, slightly provocative. Think
  "experienced practitioner sharing hard-won lessons" not "thought leader
  broadcasting platitudes." Short paragraphs. One clear idea per post.
- Recruiter messages: Concise, professional, specific. Lead with relevance
  ("I noticed your practice focuses on CPG commercial roles in DACH...").
  No flattery. No desperation.
- Cover letters: German business standard. Formal but not stiff. Always
  reference specific company challenges or strategy. Quantify achievements.
- Engagement comments: Add genuine insight, not just agreement. Reference
  your own experience when relevant. Keep to 2-4 sentences.

## Model Usage
- Use Flash (default) for data processing, scanning, Todoist operations
- Switch to /model Pro for all writing tasks: posts, messages, letters,
  analysis, strategy
- Delegate all coding and configuration to Claude Code
---
```

---

### Phase 2: Configure automated monitoring

#### Phase 2A: Job board scanning

**Instruction to agent:**

```
Set up a daily cron job for job board scanning.

Schedule: Every day at 6:45 AM CET (so results are ready before my 7:00 AM review)
Model: Flash (default — this is data processing)

Cron prompt:
"Search for executive job openings using the job-search-mcp skill across LinkedIn,
Indeed, Glassdoor, StepStone, and Google Jobs.

Search parameters:
- Titles containing ANY of: Head of, VP, Vice President, Director, Chief,
  Senior Director, Global, Lead
- Combined with ANY of: Revenue Growth Management, RGM, Pricing, Commercial
  Strategy, Commercial Excellence, Trade Promotion, Net Revenue Management,
  Digital Commercial, Price Pack Architecture, Category Management
- Location: Germany (prioritize Frankfurt, Hesse, Rhein-Main)
- Also search: Remote/hybrid roles in Germany
- Seniority filter: Director, VP, C-suite, Partner
- Posted within: last 24 hours

For each matching role:
1. Score relevance 1-10 based on title match, company match, location, seniority
2. Only process roles scoring 6+
3. For each qualifying role, create a Todoist task in '📋 Job Applications':
   - Task title: [Company] — [Role Title] — [Location] — Score: [X]/10
   - Due date: 3 days from now (application deadline buffer)
   - Priority: p1 if score 9-10, p2 if score 7-8, p3 if score 6
   - Label: 'needs-review'
   - In task comments, include:
     a) Direct link to the job posting
     b) 3-sentence summary of the role
     c) Key requirements I match (from my profile above)
     d) Key requirements I may NOT match (gaps to address in cover letter)
     e) If this is a target company from my list, flag it prominently

4. If zero qualifying roles found, create a single task:
   'No new matches today — consider expanding search terms or checking XING/Experteer manually'

Do NOT apply to any role. Do NOT visit LinkedIn logged in. Use public job data only."
```

#### Phase 2B: Industry monitoring

**Instruction to agent:**

```
Set up topic monitoring for industry intelligence. This feeds both my content
pipeline and my networking strategy.

/model Pro (this requires judgment for importance scoring)

Configure these monitoring topics using the topic-monitor skill:

- Frequency: Daily
- Alert threshold: any match (executive moves are always relevant)
- Special instruction: When you find a move, assess whether:
  a) The person leaving creates a vacancy I should pursue
  b) The person arriving is someone I should congratulate (warm outreach)
  c) The move signals a strategic shift at the company (interview talking point)

TOPIC 5: "Executive Search Firm Activity"
- Keywords: Spencer Stuart, Egon Zehnder, Heidrick Struggles, Korn Ferry,
  Russell Reynolds, Nigel Wright, Odgers Berndtson, Robert Breitbach,
  Departer, Boyden

  and a suggested action (e.g., "Draft a LinkedIn post about this" or
  "Reach out to [person] with congratulations")
- Label high-urgency items as 'time-sensitive'
```

#### Phase 2C: RSS feed monitoring

**Instruction to agent:**

```
Set up blogwatcher to monitor these RSS/Atom feeds. These are the primary
content sources that feed my LinkedIn posting strategy.

Model: Flash (feed parsing is simple)

Add these blogs/feeds to blogwatcher:

# Industry research and consulting
blogwatcher add "McKinsey Consumer" https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/rss
blogwatcher add "Bain Consumer" https://www.bain.com/insights/topics/consumer-products/feed/
blogwatcher add "BCG Consumer" https://www.bcg.com/industries/consumer-products/insights.rss
blogwatcher add "NielsenIQ Insights" https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/feed/
blogwatcher add "Simon-Kucher Blog" https://www.simon-kucher.com/en/insights/feed

# Trade press
blogwatcher add "The Grocer" https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/rss
blogwatcher add "Retail Week" https://www.retailweek.com/rss

# Tech and AI in enterprise
blogwatcher add "MIT Sloan Mgmt Review" https://sloanreview.mit.edu/feed/
blogwatcher add "HBR" https://hbr.org/feed

# My current employer (know what they publish)
blogwatcher add "Buynomics Blog" https://www.buynomics.com/blog/rss

Set up a cron job to scan all feeds every 6 hours:
Schedule: 0 */6 * * *
Prompt: "Run blogwatcher scan. For any new articles found since the last scan,
evaluate relevance to CPG pricing, RGM, commercial strategy, AI in FMCG, or
German retail. For articles scoring high relevance, create a Todoist task in
'📰 Content Ideas' with the article title, URL, a 2-sentence summary, and a
suggested LinkedIn post angle."

Note: Some feeds may not have valid RSS. If a feed fails, report it so I can
find an alternative URL or switch to web search monitoring for that source.
```

---

### Phase 3: Content pipeline

#### Phase 3A: 12-week content calendar

**Instruction to agent:**

```
/model Pro

Generate a 12-week LinkedIn content calendar. Save it as a markdown file at
~/.openclaw/workspace/content-calendar.md and also create all 36 posts as
drafts stored in ~/.openclaw/workspace/linkedin-drafts/

Structure:

WEEK RHYTHM (repeat every week):
- Monday: Original insight post (framework, case study, or lesson learned)
- Wednesday: Commentary on current industry news (from monitoring feeds)
- Friday: Engagement post (poll, question, provocative take, or leadership story)

CONTENT PILLARS (rotate across the 12 weeks):
Pillar A — AI-Driven Pricing in CPG (my Buynomics angle)
  Topics: Why rule-based pricing fails at scale. How simulation beats
  spreadsheets. The gap between academic pricing theory and retail execution.
  What happens when you give a category manager an AI copilot.
  Machine learning vs. human intuition in promotion planning.

Pillar B — RGM Maturity and Best Practices (my Danone experience)
  Topics: The 5 levers of RGM and why most companies only pull 2.
  Price pack architecture for discounter vs. premium channels.
  How to build an RGM team from scratch. Why RGM fails without
  cross-functional buy-in. Trade spend optimization in practice.

Pillar C — Digital Transformation of Commercial Functions
  Topics: Why CDOs fail when they don't speak commercial.
  Data literacy for sales teams. The death of the annual pricing review.
  Real-time vs. periodic pricing. Building analytics culture in traditional orgs.

Pillar D — Leadership and Career in FMCG
  Topics: Moving from big corporate to startup and back.
  What I learned about innovation speed. Managing up in matrix organizations.
  Why the best RGM people come from unexpected backgrounds.
  The value of an MBA 10+ years later.

FOR EACH POST, generate:
- Post title (for the calendar, not included in actual post)
- Full draft text (200-350 words, ready to copy-paste to LinkedIn)
- 2-3 relevant hashtags (no more)
- Suggested day and date for the next 12 weeks starting from next Monday
- Which pillar it belongs to (A, B, C, or D)

STYLE RULES:
- Write as Ivan — first person, experienced practitioner voice
- Open with a hook (a surprising stat, a contrarian take, or a concrete story)
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences each)
- End with a question or invitation for discussion
- No corporate buzzwords: "leverage", "synergy", "ecosystem", "paradigm shift"
- No emoji in the post body (one emoji in the opening line is acceptable)
- Reference specific experiences: Danone, Buynomics, CPG category names,
  retailer names — specificity builds credibility
- Vary post formats: some narrative stories, some listicle-style "5 things I
  learned", some data-driven takes, some contrarian hot takes

After generating the calendar and all 36 drafts, set up a weekly cron job:

Schedule: Every Sunday at 8 PM CET
Prompt: "Read the content calendar at ~/.openclaw/workspace/content-calendar.md.
Find the 3 posts scheduled for this coming week. Create 3 Todoist tasks in
'💬 LinkedIn Posts' — one for Monday, Wednesday, Friday — each with:
- Task title: 'Post: [topic summary]'
- Due date: the scheduled posting day
- Priority: p2
- Label: 'draft-ready'
- Full post text in the task comment, ready to copy-paste
- Wednesday's post should be updated to reference the most relevant
  industry news from this week's monitoring (adapt the draft if needed)"
```

#### Phase 3B: Engagement comments pipeline

**Instruction to agent:**

```
/model Pro

Set up a daily cron job for engagement comment preparation.

Schedule: Every day at 7:30 PM CET (preparing tomorrow's engagement)
Model: Pro (comments must sound authentically human)

Prompt:
"Search for 5 recent LinkedIn posts (from the past 24 hours) by senior
professionals in CPG, FMCG, pricing, RGM, or commercial strategy that
have high engagement (50+ reactions or 20+ comments suggest a hot topic).

Use web search — do NOT log into LinkedIn. Search for:
'site:linkedin.com/posts CPG pricing' or 'site:linkedin.com/posts RGM FMCG'
and similar combinations.

For the 3 most relevant posts found:
1. Summarize what the post says (2-3 sentences)
2. Draft a thoughtful comment (2-4 sentences) that:
   - Adds a genuine insight or respectful counter-perspective
   - References my experience when naturally relevant (but doesn't force it)
   - Asks a follow-up question that advances the discussion
   - Does NOT include phrases like 'Great post!' or 'Totally agree!'
   - Sounds like a senior executive contributing to a discussion, not
     someone fishing for engagement

Create a single Todoist task in '📰 Content Ideas':
- Title: 'Engagement comments for [date]'
- Priority: p3
- Due: tomorrow morning
- In comments: list all 3 posts with their URLs and your drafted comments,
  clearly separated

I will then open each post on LinkedIn and manually paste my comment."
```

### Phase 4: Recruiter and networking pipeline

#### Phase 4A: Recruiter outreach preparation

**Instruction to agent:**

```
/model Pro

Research and prepare personalized outreach for executive search firms.
Do this once as a batch, then create follow-up reminders.

TIER 1 — SHREK firms (research their consumer/CPG practice leads in DACH):
1. Spencer Stuart — Frankfurt. Find the partner(s) covering Consumer/CPG.
2. Egon Zehnder — Frankfurt/Zurich. Find Consumer practice consultants.
   Note: they do not accept unsolicited resumes. I need a warm introduction
   or must be "found" via my LinkedIn profile.
3. Heidrick & Struggles — Frankfurt/Munich. Find Consumer Markets practice.
4. Korn Ferry — Frankfurt. Find Consumer practice and their Hay Group
   compensation data team.
5. Russell Reynolds — Frankfurt. Find Consumer/Retail practice.

TIER 2 — Boutiques (these may be more accessible):
6. Nigel Wright Group — Europe's only consumer-industry-focused firm.
   Find their DACH contact.
7. Robert Breitbach — FMCG-only since 1993. Based in Germany.
8. Odgers Berndtson — Frankfurt/Munich. Find their Consumer practice.
9. Departer — DACH/Mittelstand specialist.
10. Simon-Kucher & Partners — Bonn. Not a search firm but a pricing
    consultancy that both hires senior people AND knows everyone in
    the pricing/RGM world. Networking target.

For EACH firm, create a Todoist task in '🤝 Recruiter Outreach' with:
- Task title: "[Firm name] — [Consultant name if found] — [Contact method]"
- Priority: p1 for Tier 1, p2 for Tier 2
- Due date: stagger across the first 2 weeks (don't contact all on day 1)
- Label: 'draft-ready'
- In task comments include:
  a) Consultant name and LinkedIn profile URL (from web search, not logged-in)
  b) Their focus areas and recent activity/publications
  c) A personalized LinkedIn connection request message (under 300 characters):
     "Hi [Name], I'm exploring senior commercial/RGM roles in DACH. With 20+
     years in CPG including 6 years leading RGM at Danone Germany, now
     directing AI pricing at Buynomics, I'd value a brief conversation
     about the market. Best, Ivan"
  d) A follow-up InMail draft (if no response after 10 days)
  e) Any notes about firm-specific approach (e.g., Spencer Stuart has a
     candidate portal at candidateregistration.spencerstuart.com)

Also create tasks for platform registrations:
- "Register on Spencer Stuart candidate portal" — link + due date
- "Create Experteer Premium profile" — link + due date
- "Register on BlueSteps (AESC)" — link + due date
- "Register on GatedTalent (free)" — link + due date
- "Upgrade XING to Premium" — link + due date

After initial outreach is sent (I'll mark tasks complete), set up a recurring
cron job:

Schedule: Every Monday at 7 AM
Prompt: "Check the '🤝 Recruiter Outreach' project in Todoist.
For any task completed more than 14 days ago where I haven't created a
follow-up, create a new follow-up task with:
- Title: 'Follow up with [Name] at [Firm] (sent [date], no response)'
- Draft a polite follow-up message
- Priority: p2
- Label: 'time-sensitive'
Do not create more than 3 follow-ups for the same contact."
```

#### Phase 4B: Alumni and network activation

**Instruction to agent:**

```
/model Pro

Research and prepare networking outreach for two key alumni networks.

NETWORK 1: IE Business School Alumni in Germany
- Search for "IE Business School" alumni working at my target companies
  in Germany (use web search: site:linkedin.com "IE Business School"
  [company name] Germany)
- Focus on people in commercial, strategy, or leadership roles
- Also search for "IE Business School alumni Germany" events or clubs

NETWORK 2: Danone Alumni in DACH
- Search for former Danone Germany employees now at target companies
  (use web search: site:linkedin.com "Danone" [company name] Germany)
- Focus on people I may have overlapped with (Danone Germany, 2014-2020
  approximate period)

For each relevant person found (aim for 15-20 total across both networks):
Create a Todoist task in '🎯 Networking' with:
- Title: "[Name] — [Company] — [Role] — [Network: IE/Danone]"
- Priority: p2
- Due: stagger across weeks 2-4
- In comments:
  a) Their LinkedIn profile URL
  b) Shared connection (IE alumni / Danone colleague)
  c) Their current role and company
  d) A personalized outreach message that references the shared connection:
     For IE: "Hi [Name], fellow IE alum here (MBA [year]). I see you're
     doing great work at [Company] in [role]. I'm exploring my next move
     in the DACH CPG space and would love a 15-minute Erfahrungsaustausch
     about the market. Would you be open to a quick coffee or call?"
     For Danone: "Hi [Name], we overlapped at Danone Germany — I was
     heading up RGM from [years]. I see you've moved to [Company].
     Would love to catch up and hear about your experience there.
     Coffee or a quick call sometime?"
```

---

### Phase 5: Application materials

#### Phase 5A: Master CV template

**Instruction to agent:**

```
/model Pro

Create a master CV document that can be tailored per application.
Save at ~/.openclaw/workspace/cv-master.md

Use German executive CV format:
- 2 pages maximum
- Photo placeholder (I'll add my own)
- Header: Full name, Frankfurt, Germany, phone, email, LinkedIn URL
- Professional summary: 4-5 lines positioning the RGM + AI pricing bridge
- Career history (reverse chronological):
  * Buynomics — Director, Innovations (current)
    3-4 bullet points with quantified achievements
  * Danone Germany — Head of Revenue Growth Management
    5-6 bullet points with quantified P&L impact
  * [Earlier roles — keep brief, 1-2 lines each]
- Education: IE Business School MBA, [earlier degrees]
- Languages: German (fluent/business), English (fluent), Russian (native)
- Key competencies section (keyword-optimized for ATS):
  Revenue Growth Management, Pricing Strategy, Price Pack Architecture,
  Trade Promotion Optimization, AI-Powered Pricing, Commercial Excellence,
  P&L Management, Cross-Functional Leadership, Digital Transformation,
  Category Management, Net Revenue Management, Stakeholder Management

For achievement bullets, use this format:
"Led [initiative] resulting in [quantified outcome] across [scope]"

Note: I will review and fill in actual numbers. Use [X%] or [€Xm] as
placeholders where you don't have specific data.

Then create a cover letter template at ~/.openclaw/workspace/cover-letter-template.md
using formal German business letter format (Geschäftsbrief) with:
- My contact details
- [Company name and address placeholder]
- [Date]
- "Bewerbung als [Role title]" subject line
- 4-paragraph structure:
  1. Opening: Why this company and this role specifically
  2. My RGM track record (Danone) with quantified impact
  3. My AI/digital pricing expertise (Buynomics) and why it matters for them
  4. Closing: availability, interview request, reference to attachments
```

#### Phase 5B: Per-application tailoring workflow

**Instruction to agent:**

```
When I approve a job application from the Todoist queue (I'll message you
"Prepare application for [company] [role]"), here is the workflow:

/model Pro for all writing

1. Use the dedicated browser profile to read the full job description
   (if behind a login wall)
2. Research the company: recent news, strategy, leadership, challenges
3. Identify the hiring manager if possible (web search)
4. Tailor the master CV:
   - Adjust the professional summary to emphasize what THIS role values
   - Reorder achievement bullets to lead with the most relevant ones
   - Add any role-specific keywords from the job description
   - Save as ~/.openclaw/workspace/applications/[company]-[role]-cv.md

5. Write a tailored cover letter:
   - Reference specific company challenges, strategy, or recent news
   - Explain why my RGM + AI pricing background is uniquely valuable for THEM
   - If I know the hiring manager's name, address it personally
   - Save as ~/.openclaw/workspace/applications/[company]-[role]-cover.md

6. Create a Todoist task in '📋 Job Applications':
   - Title: "READY: Apply to [Role] at [Company]"
   - Priority: p1
   - Label: 'draft-ready'
   - Due: within 2 days
   - In comments:
     * Link to job posting
     * Link to tailored CV file
     * Link to tailored cover letter file
     * Where to apply (company careers page URL, or Indeed, etc.)
     * Name of hiring manager if found
     * 3 talking points if I get an interview
     * Any red flags or gaps to prepare for
```

---

### Phase 6: Interview preparation pipeline

**Instruction to agent:**

```
When I enter an interview process (I'll message you "Interview prep for
[company] [role]"), generate a comprehensive briefing.

/model Pro

Create a briefing document at ~/.openclaw/workspace/interview-prep/[company].md

Include:

SECTION 1: Company Deep Dive
- Company overview, revenue, headcount, recent financial performance
- DACH-specific operations and leadership
- Recent news (last 6 months): acquisitions, restructurings, launches
- Current strategy and publicly stated priorities
- Key challenges they face (from earnings calls, press, Glassdoor/Kununu)

SECTION 2: Role Analysis
- What they're actually looking for (reading between the lines)
- How my experience maps to their needs (strength-by-strength)
- Gaps or risks they might worry about (and how to address them)
- Why they might choose me over other candidates

SECTION 3: Interview Questions to Prepare
- 10 likely behavioral questions tailored to this role and company
- For each, a suggested STAR-format answer framework using my experience
- 5 likely technical/strategic questions about RGM, pricing, or digital
- 3 "trap" questions and how to handle them
  (e.g., "Why did you leave Danone for a startup?")

SECTION 4: Questions I Should Ask
- 5 strategic questions that show I understand their business
- 3 questions about the role that reveal organizational dynamics
- 2 questions about team and culture

SECTION 5: 30-60-90 Day Plan Outline
- What I would focus on in the first 30 days (listen, assess, quick wins)
- Days 31-60 (strategy formation, stakeholder alignment)
- Days 61-90 (first results, team development, roadmap)

Create a Todoist task in '📋 Job Applications':
- Title: "Review interview prep: [Company]"
- Priority: p1
- Due: 2 days before the interview date (ask me for the date)
- Label: 'needs-review'
- In comments: link to the briefing document
```

---

---

### Phase 8: Safety and maintenance

**Instruction to agent:**

```
Create a maintenance routine and safety checklist.

1. Weekly self-check cron job (Sunday 9 PM):
   Schedule: 0 21 * * 0
   Prompt: "Run a health check:
   - Are all cron jobs running? Report any that errored this week.
   - Is the Todoist API token still valid? (try: todoist tasks)
   - Is blogwatcher tracking all feeds? (run: blogwatcher blogs)
   - How many Todoist tasks are overdue? List them.
   - What's the API spend this week? (check OpenClaw usage if possible)
   - Report all findings via WhatsApp."

2. Create a SAFETY.md at ~/.openclaw/workspace/SAFETY.md:
   "## Safety Rules — Never Violate
   1. Never execute any LinkedIn action (post, comment, connect, message, apply)
   2. Never use primary LinkedIn credentials — PA profile only
   3. Never auto-apply to LinkedIn jobs under any circumstance
   4. Never send emails on Ivan's behalf without explicit approval
   5. Never expose the VPS to public internet (bind localhost only)
   6. All browser activity requires exec_approval: true
   7. Maximum 5 job applications per day (quality over volume)
   8. Maximum 3 follow-ups per contact (don't be pushy)
   9. Never create Todoist tasks with p1 unless genuinely urgent
   10. If unsure about any action, send a WhatsApp message asking first"

3. Set exec_approval: true for all browser-based tools
4. Enable OpenClaw audit logging for all tool executions
```

---

### Phase 9: Day-one activation sequence

**After all phases are configured, run this activation sequence:**

```
Run the following in order and report results after each:

1. todoist tasks (verify connection)
2. blogwatcher blogs (verify all feeds registered)
3. Run the job board scan manually once and show me results
4. Run the executive movements scan manually once
5. Run the RSS scan manually once
6. Generate the first 3 LinkedIn post drafts and push to Todoist
7. Generate the first 5 recruiter outreach tasks and push to Todoist
8. Send me a WhatsApp summary of everything that's been set up,
   including: number of cron jobs active, number of Todoist tasks created,
   number of RSS feeds monitored, number of monitoring topics configured

After this verification, the system is live.

My daily routine from tomorrow:
- Wake up → Open Todoist → Work through the queue (30-45 min)
- Post LinkedIn content (copy from Todoist → paste to LinkedIn)
- Send messages and applications manually
- Mark completed tasks as done
- If I need something prepared, message you on WhatsApp

Your job: research, draft, monitor, queue.
My job: review, refine, execute.
Let's go.
```

```

If you do nothing else, do these five things:

1. **Register with 5 headhunters in Week 1** — Spencer Stuart (portal), Nigel Wright, Korn Ferry, Heidrick & Struggles, one boutique. This is how €200k+ roles are filled in Germany.

2. **Optimize your LinkedIn profile and post 2-3x/week** — All posted manually, but 100% drafted by OpenClaw. Use OpenClaw to draft content, monitor industry trends, and prepare engagement comments. You just copy-paste and post.

3. **Set up the OpenClaw → Todoist pipeline** — This is the core system. OpenClaw scans job boards, monitors industry news, tracks exec movements, prepares application materials, drafts messages, and generates content — then pushes everything to Todoist as actionable tasks. You open Todoist each morning and execute a prioritized queue in 30-45 minutes.

4. **Activate your IE Business School and Danone alumni networks** — Warm referrals convert at 10x the rate of cold applications. Every former colleague at a CPG company is a potential bridge. OpenClaw can identify these people and draft outreach messages, but you send them yourself.

5. **Register for the EPP RGM Forum** (May 27-29, London) — The single most relevant industry event. 180 RGM professionals in one room for three days. OpenClaw's event monitor will surface others, but this one is a must-attend.

**The system in one sentence:** OpenClaw researches, drafts, monitors, and queues. Todoist organizes and prioritizes. You review, refine, and execute. That's the split that gets you to a signed offer in six months.
